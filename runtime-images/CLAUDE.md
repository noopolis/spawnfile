# Runtime Images

This folder owns Dockerfiles for Spawnfile-managed runtime artifact images.

Runtime artifact images are copy sources for generated organization Dockerfiles.
They must contain pinned runtime dependencies only, under
`/opt/spawnfile/runtime-installs/<runtime>`. Do not include org source,
workspace files, auth, secrets, Moltnet credentials, or deployment state.

Each runtime image should be usable with Docker multi-stage `COPY --from=...`.
Prefer a `scratch` final stage when the artifact only needs to be copied into a
generated Spawnfile organization image.
